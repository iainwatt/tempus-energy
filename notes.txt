The challenge is to produce a single web page which will allow a user to lookup a date and a settlement period, then view a report of how much energy was produced by the following class of fuel type, both the absolute values and the percentage of total generation that fuel type accounts for.

• Coal
• Gas
• Oil
• Hydroelectric
• Nuclear
• Wind
• Interconnect

The last one, “interconnect", are cables which run into Britain from other countries, while the others are fairly well understood as electricity supply. You’ll see in the XML description that the data is actually more granular than this list of fuel type and time period, so the data will need some modification to consolidate into the above.

How this website is laid out and what it looks like is up to you. The core feature is to be able to see what’s happening at a time and a day.

I’d suggest that you use a script to translate the XML into a JSON file which is more appropriate to the needs of the web front end; then have JS read this file and display data. Use whatever technology you wish to perform this data enrichment.

Deliver the final product on github.

When we meet, have a  think about how you could use data like this to make more advanced display and we can discuss any ideas you have for expanding upon it.

Please don’t spend overly long on it, but do spend time thinking about the shape of the data and any objects you create. The quality of the code you’re producing is probably the most important thing.
